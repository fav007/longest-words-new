<details><summary markdown='span'><b>‚ö†Ô∏è ONLY IF WHALE ICON TURNS RED. OTHERWISE PLEASE SKIP ‚ö†Ô∏è</b> If after 5 minutes, the whale icon is still not steady and turns red, follow these guidelines.</summary>

:point_right: You need to make sure you are using the Hyper-V backend and not WSL2:
<ul>
<li>In the Docker Desktop app, go to <b>"Settings"</b></li>
<p><img src="https://github.com/lewagon/fullstack-images/blob/master/reboot-python/docker_desktop_settings.png?raw=true" width="600"></p>
<li>Uncheck the <b>"Use the WSL 2 based engine"</b> option</li>
<li>Click on <b>"Apply & Restart"</b></li>
<p><img src="https://github.com/lewagon/fullstack-images/blob/master/reboot-python/uncheck_wsl.png?raw=true" width="600"></p>
<li>The whale should get steady and white. If not, please ask a TA for help.</li>
</ul>

</details>

<details><summary markdown='span'><b>‚ö†Ô∏è ONLY IF INSTALLATION CRASHES AND YOU ARE ASKED TO "Enable virtualization in the BIOS" ‚ö†Ô∏è</b> Please double check with a TA before following these guidelines.</summary>
	
:point_right: This error is a bit tricky to solve, but do not worry, we are here to help ! It means Docker Desktop was not able to use Hyper-V and will have to use WSL 2.
<ul>
<li>You need to activate Virtualization in the BIOS - the easiest way to do it is to watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuTxfzCvMY">this YouTube video</a> and replicate the actions
</li>
<li>Once this is done, you might have to update the WSL 2 Linux Kernel: follow <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10#step-4---download-the-linux-kernel-update-package">these steps</a>
</li>
<li>Relaunch Docker Desktop, and the whale icon should turn white and steady</li>
</ul>
