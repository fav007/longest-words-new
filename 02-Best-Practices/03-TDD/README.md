# Test Driven Development

Test-driven development (aka **TDD**) is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: red-green-refactor. The idea of this process is to turn a requirement into one or a couple of specific test cases, run those tests to make sure they are red, then implementing the code to turn those tests green. A third step is to refactor the code while keeping the tests green.
