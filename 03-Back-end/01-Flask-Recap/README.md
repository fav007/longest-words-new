# Flask Recap

![](http://flask.pocoo.org/static/logo/flask.png)

[Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) is a **microframework** for Python to quickly build a web application.

In this exercise, we will quickly go over every important features of Flask.

## Getting started

You will work in a dedicated repository to apply the best practices covered in the previous lecture.

```bash
cd ~/code/<your_username>
mkdir flask-101 & cd $_
git init
pipenv install flask gunicorn
touch app.py
stt # Open Sublime Text
```

### Flask Boilerplate

In your `app.py` file, copy paste the following boilerplate:

```python
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)


@app.route('/')
def hello():
    return "Hello World!"
```

### Development run

Go back to your terminal and run:

```bash
FLASK_DEBUG=1 pipenv run flask run
```

The server should start. Open your browser and visit [`localhost:5000`](http://localhost:5000). You should see "Hello world!" as a text answer!

Try to edit the code and reload the page in the browser. ðŸ’¡ What is happenning?

### Production run

We can test the production configuration with:

```bash
# Ctrl-C to kill the previous server
pipenv run gunicorn app:app --access-logfile=-
```

Open your browser and visit [`localhost:8000`](http://localhost:8000). Again you should see "Hello world!".

Try to edit the code and reload the page in the browser. ðŸ’¡ What is happenning?

## Heroku

Let's try to deploy this application to Heroku:

```bash
echo "web: gunicorn app:app --access-logfile=-" > Procfile
git add .
git commit -m "First deployment of Flask boilerplate"
heroku create --region=eu
git push heroku master
heroku open                # Do you get an "Hello world?"
heroku logs -n 1000 --tail # Check the access logs are coming up
```
