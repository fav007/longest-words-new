### Installation validation ‚úÖ 

You can now close the Docker Desktop window, as it is now running in the background.

#### Signup on Docker Hub üíª
Docker Hub is a hosted repository service provided by Docker for finding and sharing container images with your team. Once you create a Docker ID (a user), you will be able to pull and push images to the Hub.

Create a personal account üëâ  [here](https://hub.docker.com/signup).

#### Login

Open a terminal and type:
```bash
docker login
```

You will be prompted for your username and password:
<p><img src="https://github.com/lewagon/fullstack-images/blob/master/reboot-python/docker-login.png?raw=true" width="700"></p>

When successful, your terminal should tell you "Login Succeeded" üôå! 

#### Hello-World !

Let's validate our Docker installation by running our first container: `hello-world`. To do so, run the following in your terminal:

```bash
docker run hello-world
```

Since you do not have any docker images on your host (as you just installed docker), 

* it will first pull the `hello-world` image from the Hub
* then run a container from this image (this one _only_ prints a message)

You should end up with something like this:
<p><img src="https://github.com/lewagon/fullstack-images/blob/master/reboot-python/hello-world.png?raw=true" width="700"></p>


##### To see the containers you have running on your hosts üëÄ:

```
docker ps
```

You don't see any ü§î ? That's normal !   
Your `hello-world` container is not running anymore: it exited as soon as it was done. Its job was simply to print a message.

##### To view all containers (even non-running ones), run:
```
docker ps -a
```

You should see a container here. What is its name ? Which image was used to run it ? What is its state ?

##### To view images on your host:
```
docker images
```

You should see your `hello-world` image, freshly pulled. You also have access to other details such as 

* the image ID, 
* the image tag (used to convey important information about the image. By default, the tag is "latest". You can have a look at [this list of tags](https://hub.docker.com/_/python): do you understand what they are here for ?),
* the image size

## I'm done! üéâ

That's it for this installer, you are good to go to the next challenge where we will deep dive into Docker commands !

But before you jump to it, let's mark your progress with the following:

```bash
cd ~/code/<user.github_nickname>/reboot-python
cd 05-Docker/00-Install-Docker-Desktop
touch DONE.md
git add DONE.md && git commit -m "05-Docker/00-Install-Docker-Desktop done"
git push origin master
```
